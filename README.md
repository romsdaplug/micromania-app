# Micromania App Requests Encode

- This an open source of the method I've used to make requests through the Micromania App while they were using Gameup.com to host their app.

- We encrypt params to make the requests using AES/Cipher.

- It is deprecated as of now because they changed their whole app but still good to understand how it worked !

(Thanks to this method, I've been able to monitor PS5 stock changes and autocheckout them).
