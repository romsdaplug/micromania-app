# Micromania App Requests Decode/Encode

- This an open source of the method I've used to make requests through the Micromania App while they were using Gameup.com to host their app.

- We encrypt params to make the requests using AES/Cipher.

- It is deprecated as of now because they changed their whole app but still good to understand how it worked !
